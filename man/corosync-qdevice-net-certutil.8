.TH COROSYNC-QDEVICE-NET-CERTUTIL 8 2016-06-28
.SH NAME
corosync-qdevice-net-certutil - tool to generate qdevice model net TLS certificates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-qdevice-net-certutil [-i|-m|-M|-r|-s|-Q] [-c certificate] [-n cluster_name]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B corosync-qdevice-net-certutil
is frontend for NSS certutil used for generating client certificate for net model of
qdevice.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -i
Initialize QDevice Net NSS certificate database.
Default directory with database is /etc/corosync/qdevice/net/. This directory
has to be writable by current user. It needs QNetd CA certificate passed as
.B -c
parameter. Certificate can be found on server running QNetd in file
/etc/corosync/qnetd/nssdb/qnetd-cacert.crt.
.TP
.B -m
Import cluster certificate and key from pk12 file.
.TP
.B -r
Generate certificate request. Certificate request is exported into
/etc/corosync/qdevice/net/qdevice-net-node.crq file. It's required to
pass cluster name
.B -n
parameter. Cluster name has to match one defined in /etc/corosync/corosync.conf.
.TP
.B -M
Import signed certificate and export certificate with private key into
pk12 file.
.TP
.B -Q
Use ssh/scp to properly set both
.B corosync-qnetd
and
.B corosync-qdevice
certificates on all nodes. It's highly recommended to use ssh agent,
otherwise ssh/scp will keep you asking for password roughly 8 times number of nodes.
.B -c
File with certificate to load.
.TP
.B -n
Name of the cluster.
