.TH COROSYNC-QNETD-TOOL 8 2016-06-23
.SH NAME
corosync-qnetd-tool \- corosync-qnetd control interface.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "corosync-qnetd-tool [-Hhlsv] [-c cluster_name] [-p qnetd_ipc_socket_path]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B corosync-qnetd-tool
is frontend to internal corosync-qnetd IPC. It's main purpose is to show important
information about current
.B corosync-qnetd
internal state.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -H
Properly shutdown
.B corosync-qnetd
process
.TP
.B -h
Display short usage
.TP
.B -l
List all clients connected to
.B corosync-qnetd
process. Output is described in it's own section.
.TP
.B -s
Display status of
.B corosync-qnetd
process.
.TP
.B -v
Display more verbose output for options
.B -l
and
.B -s
.TP
.B -c
Used only with
.B -l
option. By default, information about all clients from all clusters are displayed, with
this option it's possible to filter only to one cluster with given
.I cluster_name.
.TP
.B -p
Path to
.B corosync-qnetd
communication socket.

.SH LIST COMMAND OUTPUT
.nf
Cluster "Cluster":
    Algorithm:          Fifty-Fifty split
    Tie-breaker:        Node with lowest node ID
    Node ID 1:
        Client address:         ::ffff:127.0.0.1:52000
        HB interval:            8000ms
        Configured node list:   1, 2
        Ring ID:                1.a00000000021b40
        Membership node list:   1, 2
        TLS active:             Yes (client certificate verified)
        Vote:                   No change (ACK)
 ...
.fi

Output contains list of clusters. Each cluster has cluster common options
.I Algorithm
and
.I Tie-breaker
both configured in corosync.conf file. Information about nodes follows.
.I Client address
is  IP address and port of client.
.I HB interval
is heartbeat interval between
.B corosync-qnetd
and
.B corosync-qdevice
client. This option can be configured in corosync.conf.
.I Configured node list
is list of nodes configured in corosync.conf.
.I Ring ID
and
.I Membership node list
are self-explaining.
.I TLS active
describes if encrypted transport is used between server and client.
.I Vote
is last vote sent to
.B corosync-qdevice
client. Last ACK/NACK vote (if exists) is in parentheses.
