Last Updated: August 2011

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
master
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) exec/totempg.c in check_q_level()
   Remove hardcoded values.
   Chat to Steve about correcting the queue length calculation.

2) check max message size restrictions.

3) is this https://github.com/asalkeld/libqb/issues/1 still an issue?

4) remove "old" stuff from the man pages (logging/IPC).

5) new blackbox size might be too small (exec/logsys.c:311)

6) extend the logging config to make better use of the tracing capabilities.



We use topic branches in our git repository to develop new disruptive features
that define our future roadmap.  This file describes the topic branches
the developers have interest in investigating further.

targets can be: whitetank, needle, or future (3.0+).
Finished can be: percentage or date merged to master.

topic-onecrypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Honza Friesse
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle
Description:
Currently encryption code is located in totemudp.c, totemudpu.c, and iba has
no encryption support.  This topic merges the encryption code into a new
file such as totemcrp.c and provides a mechanism for totemnet.c to register
encrypt and decrypt functions with totem[udp|iba|udpu] and use them as
requested by the configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-netmalloc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Steven Dake
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle
Description:
The totemiba.c driver must allocate memory and assign it to a protection domain
in order for an infiniband driver to transmit memory.  In the current
implementation, totemsrp.c also allocates these same frames.  This results in
an extra memcpy when transmitting with libibverbs technology.  Memory copies
are to be avoided.  The simple solution is to have each network driver provide
a memory allocation function.  When totemsrp wants a free frame, it requests
it from the network driver.

topic-iazc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Steven Dake
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle
Description:
The totempg.c file uses alloca/memcpy to deal with misaligned data structures
to avoid bus errors on hardware which does not support unaligned access.  This
topic addresses the totempg.c code to avoid memory copies on platforms which
support unaligned access (x86/x86_64) and use the current alloca/memcpy
on platforms which don't (pretty much all other processor types).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-rdmaud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Steven Dake
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: needle or future
Description:
Currently our RDMA code uses librdmacm to setup connections.  We are not 
certain this extra library is needed, and may be able to use only ibverbs.  If
this is possible, the totem code may be more reliable, especially around
failure conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic-zerocopy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Developer: Steven Dake
Started: not started
Finished: 0%
target: future
Description:
Totem has many copies involved in messaging which we would like to investigate
removing.  Our goal is to deliver wire speed performance for rdma networks,
and if this can be achieved by our other topic investigations, we may not
further investigate this topic.  The basic idea of the topic is to handle
message assembly/fragmentation in libcpg, and have totem be responsible for
sending these pages that are shared via posix shared memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
other topics not yet defined:
* disallow binding to localhost interfae in redundant ring configuation.
* doxygenize include and lib directories.
* sort out binding to localhost in general
